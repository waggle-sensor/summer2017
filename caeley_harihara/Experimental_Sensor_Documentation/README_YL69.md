# *YL-69 Sensor*
## Part I. General Overview
### What is the YL-69?

  * Detects the humidity of the soil
  * Requires a 5V power supply
  * Type: analog
  * Output voltage decreases as the soil moisture increases

### Working Logic / Functionality
#### Output

  * Type: analog
  * Output voltage decreases when the soil is wet
  * Output voltage increases when the soil is dry

## Part II. Waggle Specific
### Application
#### How does my sensor work with a Particle Photon?
[Documentation detailing how to setup and read data from the Particle Photon can be found here.](https://github.com/charihara/Experimental_Sensors/blob/master/Photon_Instructions.md)
#### How does my sensor work with a Particle Electron?
[Documentation detailing how to setup and read data from the Particle Electron can be found here.](https://github.com/charihara/Experimental_Sensors/blob/master/Electron_Instructions.md)

### Source Code from particle.io

```C 
int rainPin = A0;

void setup() {
    
  pinMode(rainPin, INPUT);

}

void loop() {
 // read the input on analog pin 0:
  int sensorValue = analogRead(rainPin);
  Particle.publish("YL-69", String(sensorValue), PRIVATE);
  delay(60000);

}
