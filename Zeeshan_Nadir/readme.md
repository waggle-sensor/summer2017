# Pedestrian Detection and Tracking using Kalman Filter and KLT Tracker

Pedestrian detection and tracking is an important problem in the field of computer vision and is still being researched. Similar it may sound, but pedestrian detection and tracking are two separate problems. In this description, I shall discuss both the two problems, give a brief literature survey and then describe the approach that I have taken to tackle these problems.

Pedestrian detection problem is defined as
