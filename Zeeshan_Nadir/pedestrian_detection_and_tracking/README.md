This folder contains all the files needed to run the pedestrian detection and tracking module. This consists of four files:

1. [**main**](/Zeeshan_Nadir/pedestrian_detection_and_tracking/main.py)
2. [**Window**](/Zeeshan_Nadir/pedestrian_detection_and_tracking/Window.py)
3. [**trackingUtilities**](/Zeeshan_Nadir/pedestrian_detection_and_tracking/trackingUtilities.py)
4. [**imageProcUtilities**](/Zeeshan_Nadir/pedestrian_detection_and_tracking/imageProcUtilities.py)

The modules that are required to run this code are given as follows:

- **numpy**
- **cv2**

## 1. [**main.py**](/Zeeshan_Nadir/pedestrian_detection_and_tracking/main.py)
The main function of this module is in the file [**main.py**](/Zeeshan_Nadir/pedestrian_detection_and_tracking/main.py). As such, the main function doesn't receive it's input parameters through command line arguments, although the code can be modified in a straight forward way so that the main function receives all it's input parameters from the command line. Right now, all the input parameters are given at the top of the file [**main.py**](/Zeeshan_Nadir/pedestrian_detection_and_tracking/main.py) and we shall give a brief description of them here.
