This folder contains the code for pedestrian detection and tracking where the tracking part is done using background subtraction only. More specifically, in this code, I use the background subtractor to feed the measurements to the Kalman filter as opposed to using KLT tracker or using detections. It should also be noted that I also incorporate the width and height of the bounding box in my Kalman filter's state vector.
